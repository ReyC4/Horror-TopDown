## 🔴About
My game is a top-down horror experience where players take on the role of a detective tasked with finding a missing person. The investigation leads the detective to an abandoned school, shrouded in mystery and darkness. Players will navigate through eerie hallways and haunted classrooms, solving puzzles and uncovering clues to piece together the story of the missing individual. The abandoned school, with its decaying structures and unsettling ambiance, serves as the perfect backdrop for a gripping and immersive horror adventure.

As players delve deeper into the school, they will encounter supernatural elements and face chilling threats that test their courage and wits. The detective must use their skills to avoid or confront these dangers, while unraveling the dark secrets hidden within the school's walls. The game combines atmospheric horror with detective work, creating an immersive and suspenseful experience that keeps players on the edge of their seats. Each discovery and every twist in the storyline brings them closer to uncovering the truth about the missing person and the sinister forces at play.
